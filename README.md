This is an Android Application to automate the ease of personalized airport notifications directly to the users smartphone<br>
The aim of the application was to reduce the heavy reliant on voice announcements and to make easy for airport officials to issue generalised and personalized announcements directly on the user's smartphone

<br>
The application lacks interms of UI design but as far as basic functionality this works flawlessly
<br>
Notifications are sent using Firebase's API on a server
<br>
TL;DR
send notification on the mobile based on the topic it is subscribed to and/or with using the specific ID of the application
